untitled fruit-picking game

* game timer: player has 60 secs to pick as many fruits as they can
* counter: keep track of how many fruits the player has picked
* random generation: a few different types of fruit will generate randomly in the game window. maybe each fruit is worth a different amount of points? collecting tomatoes get you minus points maybeâ€¦
* game states- a start screen that explains the premise of the game, the actual game, then a game over screen that shows how many fruits (and tomatoes) were picked
